        <h2>ESTABLISHING VISION</h2>
        <h3>Christ Communications Evangelistic Ministries was established in 2016 by divine revelation through the missioner Evang. Olugbemi Oludayo for the purpose of taking the gospel of Christ to the unreached through evangelism, raising a voice in the wilderness of the world, to make straight the way of the Lord before His coming, and raising up a generation of young ones who know God.  We have been committed to this noble course ever since, doing all we can to ensure this vision is realized. And we want to do more for the Lord in our evangelical assignment. 
        We are glad to have your presence in our midst today, and will gladly take delivery of whatever God lays on your heart to give to the church for the progress of the work of God in the rural area.</h3>
