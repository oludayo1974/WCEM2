      <h3 class="short">The humble beginning of World Communications Evangelistic Ministries began in 1994 when God show the then president of Christ Apostolic Church Students’ Association Iree branch, then a student of OND Science Laboratory Technology by name brother Fagbemi Oludayo, usually called bro Olugbemi, a vision mandating him on an evangelistic mission. He ran with this vision for 21 years during which things were upside down for him. He however stated under the name Christ Communications Evangelistic Ministries in Igbusi town. 
        I usually remember what my mother Mrs B. T. Fagbemi (of blessed memory) told me when I grew up to know between right and left that when she gave birth to me that she had a strange birth of me out of all her children. Then she told me that a C/S Church prophet told her that this son of yours shall be a minister of God, so take good care of him. And that as a mark of his separation, his hair should be left uncut. She told me however that she later cut my hair after I am beginning to look different from other children years after. 
        I furthered my education and graduated with HND Biochemistry, PGD in HIV Education and management and Public Administration respectively, and PGD in Theology at the Redeemed Christian Bible College in 2013.</h3>

      <h3>However, God of covenant always come calling. 
        So He moved him to clear his long time portion of land meant for his personal building/business site for CCEM to live in and at same time start his long time call to the ministry at Igbusi on Thursday 26th of November 2015. Though for some reason I presently live in Alagbado for some reason. 
        
        The ground was cleared for the church on the said date and burnt on the second day. The excavation started on Saturday 28th of November 2015 by a team of workers which extended to Sunday 29th. 
        The foundation laying ceremony was conducted Pastor Abosede (AGE) of the CAC, supported by the visioner, Evang. Olugbemi and other team of workers which lasted for about 20 minutes.  
        Laminated printed scriptures where laid at the four corners of the church building in between three representative stones at each corner totaling twelve stones in all.</h3>

        <h3>The biblical scriptures used were: 
        Ephesian 2:20: And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the Chief corner stone
        I Corinthian 3:11: For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ
        I Peter 2:6: Wherefore also as it is contained in the scripture, Behold I lay I Sion a chief coenerstone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be confounded.
        Revelation 1:8: I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
        The scriptures were uttered and laid in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
